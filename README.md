# HOTH9 2022
## WokWalk | Alyssa Tadeo, Camille Fenson, and Nikki Ha

## Inspiration
We developed WokWalk with the intention of promoting healthy habits by making it fun for users to reach their step goals. While it's difficult to maintain an active lifestyle, users can feel motivated to walk more with the prospect of unlocking new recipes! To combine fun and health, our app drew inspiration from Pokemon Go, Flora, and Nike Run Club.

## What it Does
We intended for WokWalk to track our users' steps which contributes towards personal progress to unlocking a new recipe. For now, we present a simple design of our home screen, recipe screen, and log screen. The home screen was intended to display a progress bar at the top, a navigation bar at the bottom, a graphic of possible recipes that can be earned, a timer, and a start/pause button. The recipe screen was intended to show the recipes the user unlocked and the recipes the user hasn't unlocked yet. Lastly, the log screen was intended to show a log of all the prior walks and routes the user took.

## How We Built It
To build our project, we used React Native, JavaScript, CSS, Photoshop, the React navigation API, and GitHub.

## Challenges We Ran Into
All three members had no experience with mobile development. This was our first attempt at building a functional mobile app and we struggled with implementing screen navigation.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Although we didn't finish our project, we're proud that we learned a lot through this experience and had fun! We were able to create a functional mobile app, implement navigation between screens, implement buttons, and learn how to use different languages.

## What We Learned
We learned how to better use GitHub for collaboration, how to use React Native, how to implement buttons and navigation, and how to design and format our app.

## What's Next for WalkWok
Because we didn't finish, we hope to work on developing our app after HOTH 9!
